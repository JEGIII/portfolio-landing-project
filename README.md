## Portfolio Landing Project
This webpage is an independent project that serves as an illustration of what I have learned Epicodus' **_Intro to Programming_** course. Additionally, it will give the viewer some insight about me, a few HTML projects I've done, and background information. 

## Setup Instructions
<ol>
<li>Copy the url to the program's repository</li>
<li>Run the following command in your terminal (GitBash on Windows):</li>
<ul>
<li>"$ git remote -v"</li>
</ul>
<li>Direct to the cloned program's folder.</li>
<li>Open the HTML file using your preferred browser.</li>
</ol>
