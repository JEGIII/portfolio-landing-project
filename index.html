    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm 20 years old and am currently enrolled in Epicodus' "Intro to Programming" course. After graduating high school in 2017, I decided to postpone further education. In the meantime, I became more involved in my family's car dealership business as well as a medical assistant and real estate manager. On my free time, I love to read, play video games with friends, and spend time with my Chihuahua Rat Terrier mix, Oreo.</p>

      <p>I decided to take a class on programming, with Epicodus, because I believed they can provide me with knowledge and means to take the next step in making a career out of coding.</p>
